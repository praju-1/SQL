# Repository Structure

The SQL Repository is organized into the following sections:

3. Projects: The projects directory showcases my ability to design and implement database solutions for real-world scenarios. Each project includes a comprehensive SQL script that creates the necessary database schema, tables, and sample data. Additionally, a README file provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and instructions for running the SQL script.
